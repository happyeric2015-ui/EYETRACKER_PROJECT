Visual Tracking Tasks

Platform: 16-inch MacBook Pro, built-in 1080p webcam, 30 FPS
View Distance: ~50-60 cm (arm’s length)
Lighting: Indoor 300-500 lux
Calibration: 9-point grid (center + corners + midpoints)
Systems: For both the system designed by the student and WebGazer.js

Task 1: Fixation Stability
Goal: Measure the ability to maintain gaze on a stationary target.
Procedure:
A small dot appears sequentially at 6-10 screen positions ((center + corners + midpoints)
Each dot is displayed for 5 seconds. 
Between targets, there will be a brief blank screen (1 second)
Tasks will be completed using both the student-developed system and WebGazer.js for side-by-side comparison.
Metric:
Fixation duration (how long gaze remains within a small region around the target)
Fixation stability (e.g., standard deviation of gaze location during the 5s)

Task 2: Saccade Speed
Goal: Measure speed and accuracy of rapid eye movements.
Procedure: 
Participant watches as a dot jumps randomly between screen positions from one location to another every 1.5 seconds
20-25 trials per participant, each for the student system and WebGazer.js
Metric:
Saccade latency (time from jump to gaze movement)
Saccade speed (angular/linear speed between old and new location)
Saccade accuracy (distance between gaze endpoint and target)

Task 3: Smooth Pursuit Task
Goal: Measure the ability to track moving targets smoothly
Procedure:
Dot moves horizontally (left -> right -> left) or along a circular path at a moderate speed for about 30 seconds
Participants follow the dot with their eyes, no head movement.
Tasks will be completed using both the student-developed system and WebGazer.js for side-by-side comparison.
Metrics: 
Pursuit error (distance between gaze position and target position over time)
Gain (velocity/target velocity)
Number of catch-up saccades (frequency of gaze losing the target and needing correction)
